|[1.2](https://github.com/nmoinvaz/minizip/tree/1.2)|Drop-in replacement for zlib's minizip that includes WinZip AES encryption, disk splitting, I/O buffering and some additional fixes.|
|[1.1](https://github.com/nmoinvaz/minizip/tree/1.1)|Original minizip as of zlib 1.2.11.|

## History

Minizip was originally developed by [Gilles Vollant](https://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/minizip.html) in 1998. It was first included in the zlib distribution as an additional code contribution starting in zlib 1.1.2. Since that time, it has been continually improved upon and contributed to by many people. The original [project](https://github.com/madler/zlib/tree/master/contrib/minizip) can still be found in the zlib distribution that is maintained by Mark Adler.

My work with the minizip library started in 2006 when I fixed a few bugs I found and submitted them to
Gilles Vollant. In 2010, I implemented WinZip AES encryption, disk splitting, and
I/O buffering that were necessary for another project I was working on. Shortly after, I created this public repository
so I could share my improvements with the community. In early 2017, I began the work to refactor and rewrite
the library as version 2 because it had become difficult to maintain and code readability suffered over the years.

## Features

+ Creating and extracting zip archives.
+ Adding and removing entries from zip archives.
+ Read and write raw zip entry data.
+ Reading and writing zip archives from memory.
+ Zlib, BZIP2, and LZMA compression methods.
+ Password protection through Traditional PKWARE and [WinZIP AES](https://www.winzip.com/aes_info.htm) encryption.
+ Buffered streaming for improved I/O performance.
+ NTFS timestamp support for UTC last modified, last accessed, and creation dates.
+ Disk split support for splitting zip archives into multiple files.
+ Preservation of file attributes across file systems.
+ Follow and store symbolic links.
+ Unicode filename support through UTF-8 encoding.
+ Legacy character encoding support CP437, CP932, CP936, CP950.
+ Turn off compilation of compression, decompression, or encryption.
+ Windows (Win32 & WinRT), macOS and Linux platform support.
+ Streaming interface for easy implementation of additional platforms.
+ Support for Apple's compression library ZLIB implementation.
+ Zero out local file header information.
+ Zip/unzip of central directory to reduce size.
+ Ability to generate and verify CMS signature for each entry.
+ Recover the central directory if it is corrupt or missing.
+ Example minizip command line tool.

## Build

To generate project files for your platform:

1. [Download and install](https://cmake.org/install/) cmake (version 3.11 or later recommended).
2. Run cmake in the minizip directory.

```
cmake . -DMZ_BUILD_TEST=ON
cmake --build .
```
