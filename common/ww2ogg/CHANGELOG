                  - allow user-specified packed_codebooks.bin filenames

2011-11-15 - 0.17 - more 0x2a normal packet detection, still not certain which
                    bit indicates this

2011-10-27 - 0.15 - try to detect 0x2a vorb chunk but normal packets (0x70 at

                  * no granulepos
                  * packets missing packet type and window flags

2010-12-22 - 0.10 - allow subtype 0x3b (5 channel)

2010-10-24 - 0.9 - tolerate fmt chunk without extra "signature"

                   _conv.ogg for default output name to avoid overwriting input

2010-01-16 - 0.7 - support for vorb chunk size 0x28, which comes with
                   a nearly-complete header triad and 8 byte packet headers
                 - don't attempt to load packed codebooks if not needed
                 - print a bit more information

2010-01-16 - 0.6 - support for nearly-full (only missing time domain) setup
                   with command line switch --full-setup

2010-01-11 - 0.5 - allow subtype 0x3f (6 channel)
                 - support for inline codebooks with command line switch

                 - handier Makefiles
                 - corrected setup packet size check

2009-12-04 - 0.1 - fix buffer overflow (floor_dimension_list needs maximum_class + 1 elements)
                 - add support for LIST and smpl (looping)
                 - give more info in vendor comment
